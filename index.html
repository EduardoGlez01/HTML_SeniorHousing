<h1 class="titulo">How NYC Seniors struggles for public housing opportunities</h1>
<h4 class="balazo">While low-income seniors apply for the city's public housing schemes, more housing production is needed to ensure their chances of becoming recipients.</h4>

<p class="special"> For Elizabeth Ramirez, 66, paying the $1200 cost of her rent has become increasingly complicated, as her income, made up of $980 from Social Security and $750 a month she earns as a kitchen maid at a senior center in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, barely pays for her home and puts her other expenses such as utilities, transportation and food at risk. </p>

<p class="special"> Ramirez has lived in a rent-controlled apartment on Brooklyn's Ocean Parkway for more than 31 years, but with her retirement came a considerable income reduction, sometimes making it difficult for her to make ends meet. Because of this, in 2020, she decided to apply for Senior Affordable Rent Apartments (SARA) but has yet to be successful. "I have also applied for housing for seniors, but from then, I got nothing. Then I filled out three other forms here and there, but I still have nothing," she explained.</p>

<p class="special"> The SARA program is an initiative created in 2014 by the city's Housing and Preservation Development Department (HPD) to assist low-income seniors over 62 by offering them apartments in exchange for rents proportional to a maximum of 30 percent of their income.</p>

<p class="special"> However, for people like Ramirez, becoming a beneficiary only depends on luck, as only 4 and 6 percent of the total units constructed as part of the affordable housing programs are designated for seniors, and people can only access through lotteries organized by the NYC Housing Connect system.</p>

<p class="special"> When this article was written, there were 39 housing developments in NYC Housing Connect, but only three had units available for limited-income seniors. The Department of Housing currently has another 5,745 units in current construction for seniors of all incomes, representing just 4.5 percent of the total production of the HPD housing programs.

</script>

<p class="special"> Although the city department has no estimated date for these homes to be completed and available, the database fed since 2014 shows an average construction time of 535 days, meaning that these units may be available in at least a year and a half.</p>

<p class="special"> The Department of Development assures that it is complicated to calculate the waiting line to be a beneficiary of the program because each housing project has its waiting list, and many people have more than one application for more than one apartment. However, a study by the non-profit organization LiveOn NY estimates that the average waiting time in the city is 10.3 years in areas of Manhattan and waits of up to 7 years in places like Brooklyn.</p>

<p class="special"> For Julia Acevedo, 65, the lack of affordable housing has forced her to seek shelter with a friend, paying only utilities and some groceries. However, she said it could be better, as it has no room or privacy. “I want to have my place, just that, I want to continue working, and even retired, I will continue working, but I just need a house. That's what I want."</p>

<p class="special"> According to the American Community Survey, Acevedo is one of 227,644 seniors who live with incomes below the poverty line. To afford a space with the $15,000 she earns annually, she has no choice but to apply to these public housing schemes, which need to be revised to cover them, even though production has been consistent.</p>

<p class="special"> Inés Pinzón, a social worker at a senior center in Astoria managed by the RAICES organization, said that the housing problem is a constant among the low-income seniors that the organization usually assists. As she says, it is the beginning of several economic and even emotional complications since the process is often complex and not consistently successful.</p>

<p class="special"> "We make them a list of what they must bring to complete the application (to apply to the housing programs), but they are not always patient. They usually get disappointed when they bring the documents and the application doesn’t work. They begin to get frustrated, to get upset," she explained.</p>


<p class="special"> From fiscal year 2020 to 2022, the Housing Preservation and Development Department has delivered more than 3,900 homes for seniors. However, even when added to the homes still in construction, that number needs to serve the people below the poverty line.</p>
